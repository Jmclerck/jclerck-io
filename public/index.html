					I am currently working on the initial version of a new product to
					generate web based marketing content to be displayed on ATMs. This new
					products aims to allow marketing users to generate passive and
					interactive advertisements with little to no technical knowledge.

					As a Technical Lead, I led the initial investigation into what web
					technologies the team would use, researching the pros and cons of
					React, Web Components, Angular 2, and native Javascript. This led to
					the decision to work with Angular 2. I have also introduced and
					established coding guidelines, as well as created the first set of
					tasks needed for the new project. All tasks were created and estimated
					in accordance with Agile practices. My daily responsibilities include
					general development work for the initial release of the product and
					leading the team in technical discussions and meetings. I am also
					responsible for mentoring and assisting team members with less
					experience, in order to further their own knowledge and produce high
					-quality code.

					I worked on the development of an AngularJS and HTML5 web application
					to produce web content. The application allows the user to create rich
					web-technology based user interfaces for ATMs. In order to build these
					interfaces, the user can create and import “components”, which can
					then be manipulated and configured within the application. I was
					solely responsible for the development of a client-side validation
					module, which analyses “components” during import into the
					application. This ensures that they are valid and meet the
					application’s runtime requirements. I was made interim Scrum Master of
					the team for several months during a colleague’s leave of absence.

					My main role and responsibility at Vertual was the development and
					maintenance of software products for the training of radiotherapy
					clinicians, namely development of new content and investigation and
					rectification of customer reported errors using C++ and OpenGL.

					I was lead developer on several major projects developing new modular
					software components, enhancing my software development techniques.
					These projects also allowed the development of new skills in 3D
					modelling using Autodesk 3ds Max. The software modules were released
					as major new software features in the latest version of the software.

					I was also solely responsible for the development of a new company
					website. This required me to learn how to setup and configure Apache,
					MySQL, PHP and Joomla CMS, as well as learning how to develop new
					Joomla components using PHP, CSS and Javascript. I also assisted other
					employees in learning how to maintain and update the website as it is
					still in use today.

					I was responsible for the design and implementation of a product for
					the University of Nottingham, to be used in a study into the effective
					treatment of amblyopia using computer games and 3D technology. My main
					responsibilities were to gather software requirements, design and
					implementation of the software and to gather feedback through regular
					client meetings.

					The main software components were developed using C++ and OpenGL. I
					researched and implemented both sound playback using OpenAL and a
					scripting interface using Lua Libraries, allowing for rapid
					prototyping of new software features without the need for re
					-compilation. I also successfully developed a custom reusable
					rendering engine used throughout the software to fulfil client
					requirements.

					I liaised with developers from an outside company, who were developing
					the software for an alternate platform. The software for the alternate
					platform was successfully completed and demonstrated to the client.
